  <h1>How to play</h1>
  <p>
    You have to guess the hidden word in as many tries as you selected in the
    settings (default: 6) and the color of the letters changes to show how close
    you are.
    <br /><br />
    To start the game, just enter any word, for example:
  </p>
  <app-guess-line [guess]="guess"></app-guess-line>
  <ul class="explaination">
    <li>
      <span class="letter-wrong">T</span>
      <span class="letter-wrong">B</span> aren't in the target word at all.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="letter-maybe">A</span>
      <span class="letter-maybe">L</span> are in the word but in the wrong spot.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="letter-correct">E</span> is in the word and in the correct
      spot.
    </li>
  </ul>
